# WAVE-project
An ARM assembly language interpreter written in x86-style assembly language. Completed with Paul Lapey and Geoff Salmon. CS237 @ Williams.

Fair warning, this is an incredibly large file. The object of the assignment was to run ARM programs in the fewest possible number of x86 commands. Because of this, we made a tradeoff for program size and wrote a python script to create this final program.
